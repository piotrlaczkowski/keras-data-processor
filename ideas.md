For Timeseries Features:

Based on your current implementation, I can suggest several advanced features to enhance your time series preprocessing capabilities:

Automatic Time Series Decomposition
Implement seasonal-trend decomposition (STL) to separate time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components
This would allow models to learn from each component separately, improving performance on seasonal data

Dynamic Feature Generation
Add configurable lag feature windows that automatically determine optimal lag values based on autocorrelation analysis
Implement change point detection to identify regime shifts in time series data

Advanced Signal Processing Features
Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) layers to extract frequency domain features
Wavelet transforms for multi-resolution analysis of time series data
Spectral analysis features to capture cyclical patterns

Improved Missing Value Handling
Add specialized interpolation methods for time series (cubic spline, LOCF, etc.)
Implement masking mechanism to handle irregular time series with missing timestamps

Time-Aware Attention Mechanisms
Implement temporal attention layers that focus on relevant time steps
Create a positional encoding layer specifically for time series to encode temporal distance

Multi-Scale Processing
Implement automatic resampling at multiple time scales (hourly, daily, weekly)
Create hierarchical time series preprocessors that handle different granularities


Enhanced Seasonality Handling
Add calendar feature generation (holidays, day of week, etc.)
Implement multiple seasonal period detection and encoding

Causal Inference Features
Add Granger causality testing as a preprocessing step
Implement transfer entropy calculations for multivariate time series

Temporal Feature Extraction
Add automatic feature extraction using tsfresh-inspired statistical features
Implement shapelets detection for pattern recognition
