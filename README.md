**Transform your raw data into ML-ready features with just a few lines of code!**

KDP provides a state-of-the-art preprocessing system built on TensorFlow Keras. It handles everything from feature normalization to advanced embedding techniques, making your ML pipelines faster, more robust, and easier to maintain. Built with ❤️ by [🦄 UnicoLab](https://unicolab.ai), it provides a clean, efficient, and extensible foundation for building sophisticated machine learning models for enterprise AI applications.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🚀 **Efficient Single-Pass Processing**: Process all features in one go, dramatically faster than alternatives
- 🧠 **Distribution-Aware Encoding**: Automatically detects and optimally handles different data distributions
- 👁️ **Tabular Attention**: Captures complex feature interactions for better model performance
- 🔍 **Feature Selection**: Automatically identifies and focuses on the most important features
- 🔄 **Feature-wise Mixture of Experts**: Specialized processing for different feature types
- 📦 **Production-Ready**: Deploy your preprocessing along with your model as a single unit

## 🚀 Quick Installation

```bash
# Using pip
pip install kdp

# Using Poetry
poetry add kdp
```

## 📋 Simple Example

```python
from kdp import PreprocessingModel, FeatureType

# Define your features
features_specs = {
    "age": FeatureType.FLOAT_NORMALIZED,
    "income": FeatureType.FLOAT_RESCALED,
    "occupation": FeatureType.STRING_CATEGORICAL,
    "description": FeatureType.TEXT
}

# Create and build the preprocessor
preprocessor = PreprocessingModel(
    path_data="data/my_data.csv",
    features_specs=features_specs,
    # Enable advanced features
    use_distribution_aware=True,
    tabular_attention=True
)
result = preprocessor.build_preprocessor()
model = result["model"]

# Use the preprocessor with your data
processed_features = model(input_data)
```

## 🛠️ Development Tools

KDP includes tools to help developers:

- **Documentation Generation**: Automatically generate API docs from docstrings
- **Model Diagram Generation**: Visualize model architectures with `make generate_doc_content` or run:
  ```bash
  python scripts/generate_model_diagrams.py
  ```
  This creates diagram images in `docs/features/imgs/models/` for all feature types and configurations.
