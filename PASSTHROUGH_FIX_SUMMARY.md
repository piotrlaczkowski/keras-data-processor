# PASSTHROUGH Feature Fix Summary

## Problem Description

The PASSTHROUGH features in KDP were being incorrectly cast to float32 during processing, which prevented them from preserving their original data types (strings, integers, etc.). This was problematic because passthrough features are designed to pass data through the pipeline without any preprocessing modifications.

## Root Cause

In the `_add_pipeline_passthrough` method in `kdp/processor.py` (line ~1416), the code was automatically casting all passthrough features to float32:

```python
# For passthrough features, we only ensure type consistency by casting to float32
preprocessor.add_processing_step(
    layer_creator=PreprocessorLayerFactory.cast_to_float32_layer,
    name=f"cast_to_float_{feature_name}",
)
```

This was incorrect because passthrough features should preserve their original data type.

## Solution

### 1. Created a New Layer: `PreserveDtypeLayer`

**File**: `kdp/layers/preserve_dtype.py`

This new layer can either:
- Preserve the original dtype when `target_dtype=None` (default behavior)
- Cast to a specific dtype when `target_dtype` is specified

```python
@tf.keras.utils.register_keras_serializable(package="kdp.layers")
class PreserveDtypeLayer(keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, target_dtype=None, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
        self.target_dtype = target_dtype

    def call(self, inputs, **kwargs):
        if self.target_dtype is not None:
            return tf.cast(inputs, self.target_dtype)
        return inputs
```

### 2. Added Factory Method

**File**: `kdp/layers_factory.py`

Added a new factory method to create `PreserveDtypeLayer` instances:

```python
@staticmethod
def preserve_dtype_layer(
    name: str = "preserve_dtype", target_dtype=None, **kwargs: dict
) -> tf.keras.layers.Layer:
    """Create a PreserveDtypeLayer layer."""
    return PreprocessorLayerFactory.create_layer(
        layer_class=PreserveDtypeLayer,
        name=name,
        target_dtype=target_dtype,
        **kwargs,
    )
```

### 3. Updated Processor Logic

**File**: `kdp/processor.py`

Modified the `_add_pipeline_passthrough` method to use the new `PreserveDtypeLayer` instead of casting to float32:

```python
# For passthrough features, preserve the original dtype or cast to specified dtype
target_dtype = getattr(_feature, 'dtype', None)
preprocessor.add_processing_step(
    layer_creator=PreprocessorLayerFactory.preserve_dtype_layer,
    name=f"preserve_dtype_{feature_name}",
    target_dtype=target_dtype,
)
```

## Testing

### 1. Unit Tests for PreserveDtypeLayer

**File**: `test/layers/test_preserve_dtype_layer.py`

Comprehensive tests covering:
- Preserving original dtypes (string, int, float)
- Casting to target dtypes
- Batch processing
- Serialization/deserialization
- Model integration

### 2. Factory Method Tests

**File**: `test/layers/test_layer_factory.py`

Added tests for the new `preserve_dtype_layer` factory method.

### 3. Integration Tests

**File**: `test/test_processor.py`

Added comprehensive tests for passthrough features:
- `test_passthrough_feature_preserves_string_dtype`
- `test_passthrough_feature_preserves_int_dtype`
- `test_passthrough_feature_preserves_float_dtype`
- `test_passthrough_feature_mixed_types`

### 4. Simple Test Script

**File**: `test_passthrough_fix.py`

A standalone test script that can be run without the full test environment to verify the fix works correctly.

## Usage Examples

### String Passthrough Feature

```python
from kdp.features import PassthroughFeature, FeatureType
import tensorflow as tf

# Create a string passthrough feature
string_feature = PassthroughFeature(
    name="string_feature",
    feature_type=FeatureType.PASSTHROUGH,
    dtype=tf.string,
)

# The feature will now preserve its string dtype through the pipeline
```

### Integer Passthrough Feature

```python
# Create an integer passthrough feature
int_feature = PassthroughFeature(
    name="int_feature",
    feature_type=FeatureType.PASSTHROUGH,
    dtype=tf.int32,
)

# The feature will now preserve its int32 dtype through the pipeline
```

### Mixed Types

```python
features = {
    "string_feature": PassthroughFeature(
        name="string_feature",
        feature_type=FeatureType.PASSTHROUGH,
        dtype=tf.string,
    ),
    "int_feature": PassthroughFeature(
        name="int_feature",
        feature_type=FeatureType.PASSTHROUGH,
        dtype=tf.int32,
    ),
    "float_feature": PassthroughFeature(
        name="float_feature",
        feature_type=FeatureType.PASSTHROUGH,
        dtype=tf.float64,
    ),
}

# All features will preserve their respective dtypes
```

## Benefits

1. **Data Type Preservation**: Passthrough features now correctly preserve their original data types
2. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing code continues to work, but now with correct behavior
3. **Flexibility**: The `PreserveDtypeLayer` can be used for both preserving and casting dtypes as needed
4. **Comprehensive Testing**: Full test coverage ensures the fix works correctly
