# üíª Contributing: Join the Preprocessing Revolution! üõ†Ô∏è

Eager to contribute? Great! We're excited to welcome new contributors to our project. Here's how you can get involved:

## üí° New Ideas / Features Requests

If you wan't to request a new feature or you have detected an issue, please use the following link:
[ISSUES](https://github.com/piotrlaczkowski/keras-data-processor/issues)

## üöÄ Getting Started:

- [x] Fork the Repository: Visit our GitHub page, fork the repository, and clone it to your local machine.

- [x] Set Up Your Environment: Make sure you have TensorFlow, Loguru, and all necessary dependencies installed.

- [x] Make sure you have installed the pre-commit hook locally

  ??? installation-guide
  Before using pre-commit hook you need to install it in your python environment.

        ```bash
        conda install -c conda-forge pre-commit
        ```

        go to the root folder of this repository, activate your venv and use the following command:

        ```bash
        pre-commit install
        ```

- [x] Create a new branch to package your code

- [x] Use standarized commit message:

  `{LABEL}(KDP): {message}`

  This is very important for the automatic releases (semantic release) and to have clean history on the master branch.

- [x] Create your first Merge Request (MR) as soon as possible.

  > Merge requests will be responsible for semantic-release storytelling and so use them wisely! The changelog report generated automatically will be based on your commits merged into main branch and should cover all the things you did for the project, as an example:

- [x] Separate your merge requests based on LABEL or functionality if you are working on `feat` label

  > This about what part of feature you are working on, (messages) i.e.:

        - `initializaing base pre-processing code`
        - `init repo structure`
        - `adding pre-processing unit-tests`

- [x] Once the code is ready create a Merge Request (MR) into the MAIN branch with a proper naming convention

  > The name of your MR should follow the same exact convention as your commits (we have a dedicated check for this in the CI):

        `{LABEL}(KDP): {message}`

- [x] Use small Merge Requests but do them more ofthen < 400 lines for quicker and simple review and not the whole project !

- [x] Ask for a Code Review !

- [x] Once your MR is approved, solve all your unresolved conversation and pass all the CI check before you can merge it.

- [x] All the Tests for your code should pass -> REMEMBER NO TESTS = NO MERGE üö®
