# ‚ûï Cross Features

> Capture powerful interactions between features to uncover hidden patterns in your data.

## üìã Quick Overview

Cross features model the interactions between input features, unlocking patterns that individual features alone might miss. They're especially powerful for capturing relationships like "product category √ó user location" or "day of week √ó hour of day".

## üöÄ Basic Usage

Creating cross features in KDP is simple:

```python
from kdp import PreprocessingModel, FeatureType

# Define your features
features = {
    "product_category": FeatureType.STRING_CATEGORICAL,
    "user_country": FeatureType.STRING_CATEGORICAL,
    "age_group": FeatureType.STRING_CATEGORICAL
}

# Create a preprocessor with cross features
preprocessor = PreprocessingModel(
    path_data="customer_data.csv",
    features_specs=features,

    # Define crosses as (feature1, feature2, embedding_dim)
    feature_crosses=[
        ("product_category", "user_country", 32),  # Cross with 32-dim embedding
        ("age_group", "user_country", 16)          # Cross with 16-dim embedding
    ]
)
```

## üß† How Cross Features Work

When you define a cross feature, KDP:

1. Creates a composite feature by combining the values of the input features
2. Generates a vocabulary of all meaningful combinations
3. Embeds these combinations into a dense representation
4. Makes the interaction information available to your model

This captures non-linear relationships that would be missed if features were only processed independently.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Configuration Options

| Parameter | Description | Suggested Range |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| `feature1` | First feature to cross | Any feature name |
| `feature2` | Second feature to cross | Any feature name |
| `embedding_dim` | Dimensionality of cross embedding | 8-64 |

## üõ†Ô∏è Cross Feature Types

KDP supports several types of cross-feature interactions:

### Categorical √ó Categorical

The most common type, capturing relationships between discrete features:

```python
# Creating categorical crosses
preprocessor = PreprocessingModel(
    features_specs={
        "product_category": FeatureType.STRING_CATEGORICAL,
        "user_country": FeatureType.STRING_CATEGORICAL
    },
    feature_crosses=[
        ("product_category", "user_country", 32)
    ]
)
```

### Categorical √ó Numerical

Capture how numerical relationships change across categories:

```python
# Creating categorical √ó numerical crosses
preprocessor = PreprocessingModel(
    features_specs={
        "product_category": FeatureType.STRING_CATEGORICAL,
        "price": FeatureType.FLOAT_RESCALED
    },
    feature_crosses=[
        ("product_category", "price", 32)
    ]
)
```

### Date Component Crosses

Useful for temporal patterns that depend on multiple time components:

```python
# Creating date component crosses
from kdp.features import DateFeature

preprocessor = PreprocessingModel(
    features_specs={
        "transaction_time": DateFeature(
            name="transaction_time",
            add_day_of_week=True,
            add_hour=True
        )
    },
    # Cross day of week with hour of day
    feature_crosses=[
        ("transaction_time_day_of_week", "transaction_time_hour", 16)
    ]
)
```

## üìä Model Architecture

Feature crosses enable KDP to model interactions between features:

These visual representations show how KDP processes cross features, embedding them to capture meaningful interactions.

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Choose Meaningful Crosses**
   - Focus on feature pairs with likely interactions
   - Examples: product √ó location, time √ó event, user √ó item

2. **Beware of Sparsity**
   - Crosses between high-cardinality features can create sparse combinations
   - Use embeddings (default in KDP) rather than one-hot encoding for crosses

3. **Cross Dimensionality**
   - Choose embedding dimension based on cross importance
   - More important crosses deserve higher dimensionality

4. **Alternative Approaches**
   - For many features, tabular attention might be more efficient than explicit crosses
   - Try `tabular_attention=True` to automatically model feature interactions

## üîÑ Comparing With Alternatives

| Approach | Pros | Cons | When to Use |
|----------|------|------|-------------|
| **Cross Features** | Explicit modeling of specific interactions | Need to specify each interaction | When you know which interactions matter |
| **Tabular Attention** | Automatic discovery of interactions | Less control | When you're unsure which interactions matter |
| **Transformer Blocks** | Most powerful interaction modeling | Most computationally expensive | For complex interaction patterns |
