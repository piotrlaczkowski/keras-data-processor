# Feature-wise Mixture of Experts (FMoE)

## Overview
Feature-wise Mixture of Experts (FMoE) is an advanced architecture that employs multiple specialized neural networks (experts) to process different types or patterns of features, combined with a learned routing mechanism that directs features to the most appropriate experts.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Expert Networks
- **Numeric Experts**: Specialized in handling continuous features
  - Distribution-aware processing
  - Statistical moment preservation
  - Scale-invariant transformations

- **Categorical Experts**: Optimized for categorical data
  - Hierarchical encoding
  - Frequency-aware processing
  - Semantic similarity preservation

- **Text Experts**: Focused on textual features
  - Contextual embeddings
  - N-gram processing
  - Semantic analysis

- **Temporal Experts**: Specialized in time-based features
  - Seasonal pattern recognition
  - Trend analysis
  - Temporal dependency modeling

### 2. Router Network
- **Input**: Feature metadata and statistics
- **Output**: Probability distribution over experts
- **Architecture**:
  ```python
  class FeatureRouter(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
      def __init__(self, num_experts, hidden_dims=[64, 32]):
          self.num_experts = num_experts
          self.hidden_dims = hidden_dims
          # Feature metadata encoding layers
          self.metadata_encoder = [
              Dense(dim, activation='relu')
              for dim in hidden_dims
          ]
          # Expert selection layer
          self.expert_selector = Dense(num_experts, activation='softmax')

      def call(self, feature_metadata):
          x = feature_metadata
          # Encode feature metadata
          for layer in self.metadata_encoder:
              x = layer(x)
          # Generate expert weights
          return self.expert_selector(x)
  ```

### 3. Feature-Expert Gating
- Dynamic weight assignment for each expert
- Soft routing with temperature scaling
- Optional sparse gating for efficiency

## Implementation Benefits

### 1. Specialized Processing
- Each expert can optimize for specific feature characteristics
- Better handling of edge cases and outliers
- More focused feature transformations

### 2. Adaptive Behavior
- Dynamic routing based on feature properties
- Automatic feature-expert matching
- Better handling of distribution shifts

### 3. Improved Feature Representations
- Expert-specific feature embeddings
- Better preservation of feature properties
- More informative transformed features

## Integration Example

```python
class FeatureWiseMoE(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, num_experts=4, expert_dim=64):
        super().__init__()
        self.num_experts = num_experts
        self.expert_dim = expert_dim

        # Initialize experts
        self.experts = [
            Expert(expert_dim) for _ in range(num_experts)
        ]

        # Initialize router
        self.router = FeatureRouter(num_experts)

        # Feature metadata extractor
        self.metadata_extractor = FeatureMetadataExtractor()

    def call(self, inputs, feature_info):
        # Extract feature metadata
        metadata = self.metadata_extractor(inputs, feature_info)

        # Get routing weights
        routing_weights = self.router(metadata)

        # Process through experts
        expert_outputs = []
        for expert in self.experts:
            expert_out = expert(inputs)
            expert_outputs.append(expert_out)

        # Combine expert outputs
        expert_outputs = tf.stack(expert_outputs, axis=1)
        routing_weights = tf.expand_dims(routing_weights, axis=-1)

        # Weighted combination of expert outputs
        output = tf.reduce_sum(
            expert_outputs * routing_weights, axis=1
        )

        return output
```

## Performance Considerations

### 1. Memory Usage
- Expert models can be made lightweight
- Shared bottom layers for efficiency
- Optional expert pruning during training

### 2. Computational Efficiency
- Parallel expert computation
- Sparse routing for faster inference
- Caching of expert assignments

### 3. Training Strategy
- Two-phase training (router then experts)
- Auxiliary losses for expert diversity
- Load balancing across experts

## Usage Example in Preprocessing Pipeline

```python
# Feature-wise MoE configuration
moe_config = {
    'num_experts': 4,
    'expert_dim': 64,
    'router_hidden_dims': [32, 16],
    'expert_types': {
        'numeric': NumericExpert,
        'categorical': CategoricalExpert,
        'text': TextExpert,
        'temporal': TemporalExpert
    }
}

# Integration with preprocessing model
feature_moe = FeatureWiseMoE(**moe_config)
preprocessed_features = feature_moe(
    raw_features,
    feature_metadata
)
```
