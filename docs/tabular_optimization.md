# Optimizing Preprocessing Model for Tabular Data

## Why This Model Can Outperform XGBoost

### 1. Advanced Feature Interactions
XGBoost excels at learning tree-based feature interactions. Our preprocessing model can potentially outperform it by:

- **Multi-Resolution Feature Processing**
  - Captures interactions at different granularity levels
  - Learns both local and global feature relationships
  - Better handles non-linear feature interactions

- **Dynamic Feature Crossing**
  - Learns feature combinations adaptively
  - Discovers higher-order interactions
  - More flexible than tree-based splits

### 2. Feature Distribution Handling
While XGBoost handles non-linear relationships through tree splits, our model can:

- **Distribution-Aware Processing**
  - Adaptive normalization per feature
  - Handles multi-modal distributions
  - Better outlier processing

- **Quantile-Based Transformations**
  - Learned quantile binning
  - Adaptive boundary selection
  - Smooth probability mapping

## Key Features to Implement

### 1. Advanced Feature Encoding

```python
class TabularFeatureEncoder:
    def __init__(self):
        self.quantile_encoder = QuantileEncoder(num_quantiles=1000)
        self.distribution_encoder = DistributionAwareEncoder()
        self.interaction_encoder = DeepCrossEncoder()

    def encode(self, features):
        # Quantile encoding for better distribution handling
        quantile_features = self.quantile_encoder(features)

        # Distribution-aware encoding
        dist_features = self.distribution_encoder(features)

        # Deep cross feature interactions
        cross_features = self.interaction_encoder(features)

        return [quantile_features, dist_features, cross_features]
```

### 2. Multi-Scale Feature Processing

```python
class MultiScaleProcessor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.scales = [1, 2, 4, 8]  # Multiple resolution scales
        self.processors = [
            ScaleSpecificProcessor(scale)
            for scale in self.scales
        ]

    def process(self, features):
        multi_scale_features = []
        for processor in self.processors:
            scaled_features = processor(features)
            multi_scale_features.append(scaled_features)

        return self.combine_scales(multi_scale_features)
```

### 3. Residual Feature Learning

```python
class ResidualFeatureProcessor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.base_processor = BaseProcessor()
        self.residual_learners = [
            ResidualBlock() for _ in range(3)
        ]

    def process(self, features):
        base = self.base_processor(features)
        residuals = features

        for learner in self.residual_learners:
            residuals = learner(residuals)
            base += residuals

        return base
```

   ```python
   class DistributionAwareEncoder:
       def __init__(self):
           self.distribution_estimator = KernelDensityEstimator()
           self.quantile_transformer = QuantileTransformer()

       def encode(self, feature):
           dist = self.distribution_estimator(feature)
           if dist.is_multimodal():
               return self.handle_multimodal(feature)
           elif dist.is_heavy_tailed():
               return self.handle_heavy_tailed(feature)
           else:
               return self.quantile_transformer(feature)
   ```

2. **Deep Cross Feature Learning**
   ```python
   class DeepCrossEncoder:
       def __init__(self):
           self.cross_layers = [
               CrossLayer(units=64) for _ in range(3)
           ]
           self.deep_layers = [
               Dense(64, activation='relu') for _ in range(3)
           ]

       def encode(self, features):
           cross = features
           deep = features

           for cross_layer, deep_layer in zip(
               self.cross_layers, self.deep_layers
           ):
               cross = cross_layer(cross)
               deep = deep_layer(deep)

           return self.combine([cross, deep])
   ```

3. **Multi-Head Attention for Features**
   ```python
   class FeatureAttention:
       def __init__(self):
           self.attention_heads = MultiHeadAttention(
               num_heads=8,
               key_dim=32
           )
           self.feature_projector = Dense(256)

       def process(self, features):
           projected = self.feature_projector(features)
           attended = self.attention_heads(
               projected, projected, projected
           )
           return self.combine([features, attended])
